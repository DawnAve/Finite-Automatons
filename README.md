# Finite-Automatons
Finite Automatons, including NFAs and DFAs. You can build your own FAs based on your rule of an accepting String, for example, ending in "cat". In short, NFAs and DFAs recognize strings that are in a specific pattern. 
There is also a function that can transform any NFAs into DFAs, although it is sometimes time-consuming. 
You can find a REPL.c, that is the file you should run to run everything. It is an input and output loop that first asks for input, processes it, outputs it, and waits for the next input or quit.
